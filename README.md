Hello, I'm Jitendra Prajapati!
I’m passionate about building scalable backend systems and microservices-based applications that power real-world platforms. With a background in Computer Science and hands-on experience in Java, Spring Boot, and RESTful APIs, I focus on creating secure, high-performance backend solutions. I enjoy working on system design, API security, caching, and event-driven architectures to build reliable software systems.
